## About
I'm taking Max Schwarzmueller's course on Angular 7, even though I've been using Angular 5 and 6 in production.  It wouldn't hurt to see what other devs are doing with the framework.  I'm a little bit more precise and explicit in my naming conventions than Max though, and I will be adding some stuff that wasn't in the course.
